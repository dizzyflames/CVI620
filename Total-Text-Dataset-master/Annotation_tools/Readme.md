Total-Text-Tool (T3) is a guided annotation framework that is designed to reduce annotation time. In our experiment, T3 reduces annotation time by 25%. For more details of T3 and all related experiments, please refer to our [IJDAR journal publication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10032-019-00334-z).

We make all three variants of T3 available. 
1) T3_v1 - the baseline version, the suggestion mechanism is not incorporated. 
2) T3_v2 - the suggestion mechanism is incorporated, only suggest rectangle bounding box, polygon is not suggested.
3) T3_v3 - suggests both rectangle and polygon bounding box. 

Kindly refer to 'T3_use_cases' for different use cases of T3_v3.
